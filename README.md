### Statsmodels Example

An example of how you can use the statsmodels library in Python to 
build an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model for 
time series forecasting:
 
Make sure to replace 'your_data.csv' with the path to your actual data file. 
Adjust the values of p, d, and q according to your data and model requirements.
Also, consider whether differencing is necessary to make your data stationary,
and modify the code accordingly.
